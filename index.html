            I am a fullstack developer who have stopped coding for a while but
            now I am back in the game. It seems that the best way is to start
            from the basics, HTML & CSS, and that is when I looked at my love of
            food. This is a webpage for my favourite dishes from different
            cuisines around the world. I hope you enjoy it!

                <p>
                  Koshari is an Egyptian-street dish and it is one of my
                  favourites on the Egyptian list. It is popular across Egypt as
                  its pyramids are across the world. It consists of rice,
                  lentils and pasta topped with tomato sauce and fried onions.

                <h4>Stuffed pigeon</h4>
                <p>
                  Stuffed pigeon is a very popular main dish in Egypt and many
                  other countries in the Middle East. This dish consists of
                  whole pigeons stuffed with rice. Whenever this plate is on the
                  table beside so many other choices, I always pick stuffed
                  pigeons.

                <p>
                  Molokhia is a very healthy dish made of minced Jute leaves.
                  This common dish in Egypt has three times the calcium and
                  phospherous as Kale, and four times the amount of riboflavin.
                  It also provides 70% of the RDA value for Vitamin C, 25% of
                  the RDA of Vitamin A amongst a host of other minerals and
                  vitamins.

                  I've tried this amazing dish for the first time at uni and I
                  loved it since that day! The full english breakfast often
                  consists of bacon, eggs, sausage, mushrooms, baked beans,
                  toast, hash browns and grilled tomatoes. I love mine to
                  include scrambled eggs, sausage, baked beans, hash browns,
                  toast and butter.

                  It is an English national dish. Fish that is deep-fried in a
                  crispy batter served with fat golden chips on the side is
                  still one of Britain and Ireland's favourite meals. Not all
                  restaurants know how to make a proper fish and chips and if it
                  is not done in the right way I can't swallow it!

                <h4>Pizza Margherita</h4>
                <p>
                  When Queen Margherita came to visit Naples in 1889, she was
                  charmed by a local pizza baker who had made, in her honor, a
                  pizza with the colors of the new flag of the just-unified
                  Italy—red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil. It’s
                  now called the pizza margherita. The authentic italian pizza
                  is an amazing choice when I am in a bad mood or I want to
                  treat myself. I can eat pizza for 2-3 days and that is how
                  much I love it!

                <h4>Macaroni and cheese</h4>
                <p>
                  There can be no doubt that its ultimate origins are Italian,
                  as one finds macaroni and cheese recipes from the late
                  thirteenth century in southern Italy. This is an easy dish to
                  prepare and it could be done in a short time. My heart melts
                  when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and full of cheese.

                <p>
                  Cannelloni are pasta tubes that have different fillings but my
                  favourite and one of the most popular italian ones is the
                  creamy spinach and ricotta filling, baked in a super simple
                  and delicious tomato sauce and topped with melting mozzarella
                  cheese. I prefer this filling over the minced beef and other
                  options. I also like to add béchamel to it which will give it
                  a creamier texture and taste.

                  Chicken tikka masala is a dish of chunks of roasted marinated

                  orange-coloured. I really love indian spices and sauces. The
                  idea of loving indian food doesn't mean I love spicy food
                  though. I prefer my tikka masala to be mild or medium.

                  Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. It is
                  one of the most popular curries at any Indian restaurant
                  around the world. It is prepared in a buttery gravy with the
                  addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich
                  texture. I tried it in few restaurants and unfortunately not
                  many places can do it properly.

                <p>
                  Naan is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread found in the cuisines mainly of Western Asia, South Asia, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Caribbean.
                  It is made from maida, an Indian white flour that is very delicate and powdery, similar to pastry flour. It is eaten most often with curry, used instead of a spoon to sop up all of the sauce. I love to dip naan in indian sauces or even any sauce.

                  Chicken katsu curry is known as a western style dish in Japan. It compromises of panko breadcrumb coated chicken in a thick curry sauce and rice. First time I tried it was at Wasabi, a fast food rastaurant chain based in the UK, and I absolutely loved it. When I am close to Wasabi and I am feeling hungry I always choose katsu curry cause it is hard to resist a very tasty dish like that!

                  I don't think I know a person who doesn't like noodles and almost everyone I know loves prawn. When these 2 ingredients are mixed together it is like I am listening to an amazing symphony. It is an easy dish to make and it doesn't require long time to prepare. My favourite prawn noodles is the pad thai at Wagamama restuarant.
