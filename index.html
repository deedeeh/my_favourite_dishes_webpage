            I am a fullstack developer who have stopped coding for a while but
            now I am back in the game. It seems that the best way is to start
            from the basics, HTML & CSS, and that is when I looked at my love of
            food. This is a webpage for my favourite dishes from different
            cuisines around the world. I hope you enjoy it!

                <p>
                  Koshari is an Egyptian-street dish and it is one of my
                  favourites on the Egyptian list. It is popular across Egypt as
                  its pyramids are across the world. It consists of rice,
                  lentils and pasta topped with tomato sauce and fried onions.

                <h4>Stuffed pigeon</h4>
                <p>
                  Stuffed pigeon is a very popular main dish in Egypt and many
                  other countries in the Middle East. This dish consists of
                  whole pigeons stuffed with rice. Whenever this plate is on the
                  table beside so many other choices, I always pick stuffed
                  pigeons.

                <p>
                  Molokhia is a very healthy dish made of minced Jute leaves.
                  This common dish in Egypt has three times the calcium and
                  phospherous as Kale, and four times the amount of riboflavin.
                  It also provides 70% of the RDA value for Vitamin C, 25% of
                  the RDA of Vitamin A amongst a host of other minerals and
                  vitamins.

                <p>
                  I've tried this amazing dish for the first time at uni and I
                  loved it since that day! The full english breakfast often
                  consists of bacon, eggs, sausage, mushrooms, baked beans,
                  toast, hash browns and grilled tomatoes. I love mine to
                  include scrambled eggs, sausage, baked beans, hash browns,
                  toast and butter.

                <h4>Fish and chips</h4>
                <p>
                  It is an English national dish. Fish that is deep-fried in a
                  crispy batter served with fat golden chips on the side is
                  still one of Britain and Ireland's favourite meals. Not all
                  restaurants know how to make a proper fish and chips and if it
                  is not done in the right way I can't swallow it!

                <h4>Pizza Margherita</h4>
                <p>
                  When Queen Margherita came to visit Naples in 1889, she was
                  charmed by a local pizza baker who had made, in her honor, a
                  pizza with the colors of the new flag of the just-unified
                  Italy—red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil. It’s
                  now called the pizza margherita. The authentic italian pizza
                  is an amazing choice when I am in a bad mood or I want to
                  treat myself. I can eat pizza for 2-3 days and that is how
                  much I love it!

                <h4>Macaroni and cheese</h4>
                <p>
                  There can be no doubt that its ultimate origins are Italian, as one finds macaroni and cheese recipes from the late thirteenth century in southern Italy. This is an easy dish to prepare and it could be done in a short time. My heart melts when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and full of cheese.
