          <h2>A short note about myself</h2>
          <p>
            I am a fullstack developer who have stopped coding for a while but
            now I am back in the game. It seems that the best way is to start
            from the basics, HTML & CSS, and that is when I looked at my love of
            food. This is a webpage for my favourite dishes from different
            cuisines around the world. I hope you enjoy it!

                  by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                  The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                  normal distribution of letters.
